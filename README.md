# Mission Statement

The mission of this repository is to provide a comprehensive and adaptable template for implementing Selenium across multiple programming languages, enabling seamless test automation integration. This repository is designed to serve as a foundational resource for developers and QA engineers, facilitating the creation, execution, and management of automated tests in both local and cloud environments.

With templates that showcase best practices in structuring tests, using the Cucumber framework for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), and integrating continuous testing in CI/CD pipelines, this repository aims to streamline automation efforts and ensure consistency in testing across diverse workflows.

## Key Goals

- **Multi-language Support**: Offering templates that demonstrate how to use Selenium with various programming languages, ensuring flexibility and adaptability for any project.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Enabling test execution directly from pipelines within Docker containers or cloud services like Sauce Labs and BrowserStack, ensuring reliable, scalable, and distributed testing.

- **Automated Triggering**: Supporting pipelines that can be triggered automatically on every push to the repository or externally from other linked repositories.

- **Structured Test Framework**: Providing guidelines on how to structure tests to ensure readability, maintainability, and scalability, following best practices for test automation.

- **Cucumber Framework**: Implementing and demonstrating the integration of the Cucumber framework for BDD, allowing easy collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders by using plain language test scenarios.

By offering these templates and tools, this repository seeks to accelerate the adoption of effective automation strategies, reduce test cycle times, and ensure high-quality software delivery across various platforms and environments.
